# container-automation
 - These are basic containers I use for QoL
 - Use of these containers assume podman, but can tweak them to work with docker.. usually by just changing the command and any sockets in use.
 - Portainer is a very easy to use container management tool. Recent updates allow it to work with podman although it is designed mainly for docker.
